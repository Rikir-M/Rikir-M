### Oh hi!

- I’ve been interested in animations on those crazily beautiful websites these days 🤓
- So, I’m currently learning to draw with canvas API and laying my hands on GSAP 😏
- And trying to pass JLPT N3 this December without studying kanji (I know I won't) (ps. damn I passed) 😵‍💫
- If you want to know more about a video game nerd who is obsessed with creative web design (and animation, AND games), you can just click [this](mailto:hsuyatimyo11@gmail.com)
